# 3DScene
For this project, I was tasked with using a 2D scene or picture to recreate a 3D scenario in Visual Studio 2022. I developed the 3D objects, added camera movement for dynamic navigation, and applied realistic textures to the objects. This combination enhanced the overall authenticity and immersive quality of the 3D scene.
