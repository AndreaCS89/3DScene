# 3DScene
For this project, I was tasked with using a 2D scene or picture to recreate a 3D scenario in Visual Studio 2022. I developed the 3D objects, added camera movement for dynamic navigation, and applied realistic textures to the objects. This combination enhanced the overall authenticity and immersive quality of the 3D scene.

**1. How do I approach designing software?**
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  Working on the 3D scene project has increased my skills in spatial design, 3D modeling, and lighting. I learned how to create realistic textures and integrate them into a 3D environment, adding depth and authenticity to my project. Additionally, the process of animating the camera movement refined my understanding of perspective and dynamic scene composition.         Incorporating lighting further improved my ability to create realistic and visually appealing scenes.

  **What design process did you follow for your project work?**
  My design process began with conceptualization, where I outlined the elements I wanted to include in my 3D scene. I then moved to prototyping, creating basic shapes and arranging them to form the layout. After this, I focused on detailing, adding textures, refining shapes, and integrating lighting to enhance realism. Finally, I incorporated camera movements to        enrich the user experience.

  **How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
  The iterative design approach and attention to detail I used can be applied to any future project. Starting with a clear conceptualization and progressively adding details ensures a strong foundation and a polished final product. The experience with 3D modeling, texturing, and lighting will be valuable for future projects involving visual elements or user         
  interfaces, increasing both aesthetic quality and functionality.

**2. How do I approach developing programs?**
  **What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
  I used modular development strategies, breaking down the project into manageable components such as the table, notebook, marker, keyboard, mouse, and phone case. This allowed me to focus on one element at a time, ensuring each part was well-crafted before integrating them into the larger scene. I also utilized iterative testing, frequently running the program 
  to check for errors and make adjustments. Integrating lighting required a careful balance of light sources and shadows to create a realistic atmosphere.

  **How did iteration factor into your development?**
  Iteration was crucial in my development process. By repeatedly testing and refining each component, including the lighting setup, I was able to identify and fix issues early on. This iterative process helped me to progressively improve the overall quality of the scene, ensure smooth camera movements, and achieve the desired lighting effects.
  **How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**
  My approach has become more structured and detail-oriented. At first, I focused on getting the basic shapes and movements right. As the project progressed, I paid more attention to optimizing the code, enhancing performance, adding intricate details, and perfecting the lighting setup. This evolution in my approach has made me more proficient in managing difficult 
  projects and has improved my problem-solving skills.

**3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
    **How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**
      Computational graphics and visualizations have provided me with a solid understanding of 3D modeling, texturing, lighting, and animation. These skills are essential for fields such as game development, virtual reality, and simulation, which are areas I am interested in exploring further in my educational journey. The ability to create detailed and dynamic             visual representations will be invaluable in any advanced computer science or engineering coursework.
    **How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**
      Professionally, the skills I have developed in creating 3D scenes, lighting, and animations can be applied in various industries such as entertainment, education, and product design. Being able to create realistic and interactive visualizations can enhance presentations, improve user experiences, and aid in the development of cutting-edge technology. My               experience with this project has equipped me with practical skills and a deeper understanding of how to leverage computational graphics to solve real-world problems and create engaging digital content.
